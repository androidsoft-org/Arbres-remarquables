 Originally from Verzy south of Reims in the Marne where one finds the largest number of beech trees. It rarely exceeds four to five meters high. The Faux are characterized by slow growth, tormented and durability. The word "fau" meant in Old French beech and Sylvatica for forestry. It is assumed that the fall of a radioactive meteor would have caused this change centuries ago.
