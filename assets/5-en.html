 Native to Europe, North Africa and Western Asia. Also known elm leaf charm. This genus has been largely decimated in Paris by the outbreak of elm disease in the 1970s. The large wound extending longitudinally of the foot into the crown was caused by lightning. Planted in memory of the famous elm around which the local people, the Middle Ages, gathered to pay their debt.
