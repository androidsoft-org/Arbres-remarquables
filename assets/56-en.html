 Native to eastern United States. Dedicated to Jean Robin, gardener to Henry IV, who introduced the plant in France (Jardin des Plantes, Square Viviani) = pseudoacacia locust because this tree has thorns, fruit pods and leaves imparipinnately compound, like other species of the genus Acacia. This tree is suitable for poor soils. It is honey, its wood is used for grape stakes as very hard and resistant to decay, allows the determination of slope as it suckers a lot, it has become naturalized and became invasive.
